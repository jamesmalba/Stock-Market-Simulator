# Stock-Market-Simulator
Stock market simulator using python django framework. 
Allows you to create a portfolio and buy/sell stocks taken from Yahoo Finance. 
As an occasional trader I have always wanted to create an app like this. Overall, I am satisfied with the core features and now I want to implement some interesting features such as fast-forwarding. 

Future features to be added:
- The ability to simulate the performance of your portfolio by fast-forwarding by the time period of your chosing.
- A proper authentication system for users to create their own account and login. 
- Ability to create alerts
- Different types of orders
